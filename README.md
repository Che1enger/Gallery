Hello, it`s my new small project!

This time it's a gallery.This gallery is built with React and using the UnsplashAPI to display images. I implemented a random arrangement of pictures on the page.

When entering the site, we see a choice of 3 halls that we can get into!
Each room has its own paintings or photos.
Below is a photo gallery.
